## Data Description

![EEG and EOG setup](fig/EEG-electrodes.001.png)

### EEG and EOG signals
* A _g.USBamp RESEARCH_ was used to recored EEG and EOG signals.
* The sampling rate was set at 1200 Hz.
* **EEG**: 11 electrodes were placed on *FCz*, *C3*, *Cz*, *C4*, *CP3*, *CPz*, *CP4*, *P3*, *Pz*, *P4*, and *POz*
* **EOG**: 2 electrodes were placed on under (*VEOG*) and next (*HEOG*) to the outer canthus of the right eye
* The impedance of both EEG and EOG signals was maintained at below 10 *k*Î© throughout the experiment
