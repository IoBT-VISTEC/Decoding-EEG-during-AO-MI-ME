## Data Description

![EEG and EOG setup](fig/EEG-electrodes.001.png)

### EEG and EOG signals
* A _g.USBamp RESEARCH_ was used to recored EEG and EOG signals.
* The sampling rate was set at 1200 Hz.
* **EEG**: 11 electrodes were placed on _FCz_, _C3_, _Cz_, _C4_, _CP3_, _CPz_, _CP4_, _P3_, _Pz_, _P4_, and _POz_
* **EOG**: 2 electrodes were placed on under (VEOG) and next (HEOG) to the outer canthus of the right eye
* The impedance of both EEG and EOG signals was maintained at below 10 *k* â„¦ throughout the experiment
